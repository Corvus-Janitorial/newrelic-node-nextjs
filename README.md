# New Relic Next.js Instrumentation [![Next.js Instrumentation CI][1]][2]

New Relic's official Next.js framework instrumentation for use with the New Relic [Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic).

This module is a dependency of the agent and is installed by default when you install the agent.

This module provides instrumentation for Server-Side Rendering via [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware), and New Relic Transaction naming for both page and server requests. It does not provide any instrumentation for actions occurring during build, client-side code.  If you want telemetry data on actions occurring on client(browser), you can [inject the browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

Here are documents for more in-depth explanation around [transaction naming](./docs/transactions.md), [segments/spans](./docs/segments-and-spans.md), and [injecting browser agent](./docs/inject-browser-agent.md).

## Installation

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the agent. You can see agent install instructions [here](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation-and-getting-started).

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main New Relic Node.js Agent.

```
npm install @newrelic/next
```

```js
NODE_OPTIONS='-r @newrelic/next' next your-program.js
```


If you cannot control how your program is run, you can load the `@newrelic/next` module before any other module in your program. However, we strongly suggest you avoid this method at all costs.  We found bundling when running `next build` causes problems and also will make your bundle unncessarily large.

```js
require('@newrelic/next')

/* ... the rest of your program ... */
```

### Custom Next.js servers
If you are using next as a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server), you're probably not running your application with the `next` CLI.  In that scenario we recommend running the Next.js instrumentation as follows.

```js
node -r @newrelic/next your-program.js
```

For more information, please see the agent [installation guide][3].

## Getting Started

Our [API and developer documentation](http://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/docs/) for writing instrumentation will be of help. We particularly recommend the tutorials and various "shim" API documentation.

## Client-side Instrumentation

Next.js is a full stack React Framework.  This module augments the Node.js New Relic agent, thus any client-side actions will not be instrumented. However, below is a method of adding the [New Relic Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) to get more information on client-side actions.

```js
import Head from 'next/head'
import Layout, { siteTitle } from '../../components/layout'
import utilStyles from '../../styles/utils.module.css'
import Link from 'next/link'


export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // You must require agent and put it within this function
  // otherwise it will try to get bundled by webpack and cause errors.
  const newrelic = require('newrelic')
  const browserTimingHeader = newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()
  return {
	props: {
  	browserTimingHeader
	}
  }
}

export default function Home({ browserTimingHeader }) {
  return (
	<Layout home>
  	<Head>
    	<title>{siteTitle}</title>
  	</Head>
  	<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: browserTimingHeader }} />
  	<section className={utilStyles.headingMd}>
    	<p>It me</p>
    	<p>
      	This page uses server-side rendering and uses the newrelic API to inject
      	timing headers.
    	</p>
      <div>
      	<Link href="/">
        	<a>‚Üê Back to home</a>
      	</Link>
    	</div>
  	</section>
	</Layout>
```

For static compiled pages, you can use the [copy-paste method](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#copy-paste-app) for enabling the New Relic Browser agent.

For more information, please see the agent [compatibility and requirements][4].

## Testing

The module includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify that your changes don't break existing functionality.

All tests are stored in `tests/` and are written using
[Tap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) with the extension `.test.js`(unit), or `.tap.js`(versioned).

To run the full suite, run: `npm test`.

Individual test scripts include:

```
npm run unit
npm run versioned
```
